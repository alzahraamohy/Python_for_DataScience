--if we have 45 + 5 + 2 + 1 , then we call the numbers "operands" and the addictive symbol "operator"
--python can do different math operations ( + , - , * , /) and so on.. , "//" is for integer division ex: 25//6 = 4 but 25/6 = 4.166
--python follows the mathematical conventions (precendence), like multiplying before adding and so on..
  
--when we assign a value to a variable A we use "=" operator
  A = 5
-- but if we want to replace the valuse anytime in the code we use ":" operator , and the first value is missed
  A : 8
-- we can perform operations on A
  y = 2 * 5
  y : A / 2
--
